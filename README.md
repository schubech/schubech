- 👋 Hi, I’m Christine @schubech
- 👀 I’m interested in R and statistics in combination for applying it on usually skewed data from analyzed environmental samples, carrying natural parameters, as TOC
in different soil samples or Detector Counts of an instrument for specific molecules, that were measured in these environmental samples...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning methods in analytical organic chemistry, always R as a tool for analyzing data (also statistically) and plotting and about contaminants and their environmental fate
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on natural biological, photochemical, and physical processes taking place in native soil, analytical chemistry in general and specific contaminants, called PFAS
(per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances)
- 📫 How to reach me : via direct messages, that are forwarded to my daily checked mail
